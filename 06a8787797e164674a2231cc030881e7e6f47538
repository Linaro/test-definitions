      "message": "yeah, you can\u0027t make that assumption. after some testing I achieved this which is away of listing wireless interfaces that does not depend on having any special tool (like the ones from the wireless-tools package):\n\n$ ls -1d /sys/class/net/*/wireless | xargs dirname | xargs basename \n\nthis should list *all* wireless interfaces. if you want to make the test generic enough to also work with multiple interfaces you could loop over the lines output by that command, testing a wireless download for every available interface. or, if it\u0027s safe to assume that there will always be only one, you can just take the first (head -1) or the last (tail -1).",
