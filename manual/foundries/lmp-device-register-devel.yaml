    environment:

run:
    steps:
        - Ensure factory has a least 2 targets tagged "devel" and a more recent "main" target
        - Flash device with older "devel" target
        - Boot up the device
        - Run "lmp-device-register -t devel -n <name>"
        - Authenticate device with user code in browser

    expected:
        - Device should update to most recent "devel" target NOT more recent "main" target
        - Device should only update to "devel" tagged builds
        - No kernal crashes
