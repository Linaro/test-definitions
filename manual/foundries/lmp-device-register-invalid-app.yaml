run:
    steps:
        - Boot up the device
        - Ensure device is not registered to a factory
          Check /var/sota/sql.db  is not present on device
        - Register app which is not defined in containers.git
          Run "lmp-device-register -apps foo-app -n <name>"
        - Authenticate device with user code in browser
        - Verify  no apps are enabled on device
          Run "fioctl devices list -f <factory>"
          Run "docker ps" on device

    expected:
        - Device should register normally
        - Specifying a specifc app which does not exist during registration overrides default to enable all apps
        - No apps should be available on device
