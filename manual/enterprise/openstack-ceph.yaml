    steps:
        - Any test cloud for will have at least 6 nodes.
          3 controllers and 3 compute nodes. The three controllers
          will have Ceph monitors installed, the 3 compute nodes
          will have Ceph OSDs.
        - Install CentOS on all nodes
        - Deploy OpenStack + Ceph on all the nodes using the Reference
          Architecture.
        - Bootstrap the cloud with the services and users required
          (a script will be provided).
        - Create a test tenant and spin a VM to be able to run tempest from it.
        - Use RefStack to run the 2016.08 guideline. Guideline can be obtained
          here - https://refstack.openstack.org/#/guidelines

    expected:
        - It is possible to bootstap a VM
        - All tempest tests pass
