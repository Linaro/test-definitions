run:
    steps:
        - boot up the device
        - ensure the device is not currently registered to a factory
        - ensure multiple apps exist within the factory
        - register 1 or more but not all available apps to device
        - run "lmp-device-register -apps<appname,appname> -n<name>"
        - authenticate device with user code in browser   
        - Verify only specified apps are enabled
        - run "fioctl devices list -f <factory>"
                       
    expected:
       - Device should register normally
       - Only specified apps should be enabled on the device
       - it is possible to assign non-existent apps during registration with no effect
