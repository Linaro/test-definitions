    steps:
        - boot up the device
        - ensure the device is not currently registered to a factory
        - Run lmp-device-register -n <name> -i <hwid> 
        - authenticate device with user code in browser 
        - check device hwid factory>devices    
                       
    expected:
       - Device should register normally
       - <hwid> will overwrite value in /usr/lib/sota/conf.d/40-hardware-id.toml
