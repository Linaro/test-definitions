                  RAID1(mirroring) and RAID5(striping with distributed parity).
                  This test covers RAID creating, deleting and rebuilding."

run:
    steps:
        - Install OS on the SUT(system under test) and make sure it boots.
        - Power off the SUT and install three extra hard drives(use sd[b|c|d]
          here). The three hard drives shoud have the same mode, at least the
          same capacity.
        - Boot to OS and make sure mdadm utility installed.
        - Create 'Linux RAID auto' partition on each of the three hard drives
          by running the following steps.
        - 1) "fdisk /dev/sdx"
        - 2) Delete all existing partitions with fdisk command "d"
        - 3) Create Linux raid auto partition with fdisk commands
             "n -> p -> 1 -> enter -> enter -> t -> fd -> w"
        - Run the folliwng steps to test RAID0.
        - 1) "mdadm -C /dev/md0 -l raid0 -n 2 /dev/sd[b-c]1"
        - 2) 'cat /proc/mdstat' to see if md0 created and running."
        - 3) "mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0"
        - 4) Run dd performance test on md0
             "automated/linux/dd-wr-speed.sh -p /dev/md0 -t ext4"
        - 5) Inspect the above test result. Compare with test result on single
             disk, you should see performance boost.
        - Remove the md0 by running the following steps.
        - 1) "umount /dev/md0"
        - 2) "mdadm --stop /dev/md0"
        - 3) "mdadm --remove /dev/md0"
        - 4) "mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1"
        - Run the following steps to test RAID1.
        - 1) "mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=mirror --raid-devices=2 /dev/sd[b-c]1"
        - 2) Monitor '/proc/mdstat' to check if md0 created and running.
        - 3) "mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0"
        - 4) "mount /dev/md0 /mnt"
        - 5) "echo 'RAID1 test' > /mnt raid1-test.txt"
        - 6) Intentionally set faulty partition with command
             "mdadm --manage --set-faulty /dev/md0 /dev/sdc1"
        - 7) Execute "mdadm --detail /dev/md0" and check if RAID array shown as
             'degraded' and sdc1 shown as 'faulty spare'.
        - 8) Execute "mdadm --manage /dev/md0 -r /dev/sdc1" to remove sdc1.
        - 9) Verify that '/mnt/raid1-test.txt' is not damaged.
        - 10) Execute "mdadm --manage /dev/md0 -a /dev/sdd1" to add sdd1.
        - 11) Monitor the output of "mdadm --detail /dev/md0" and make sure
              that md0 'rebuilding' can be finished.
        - Run the following steps to test RAID5.
        - 1) Remove the existing md0. Refer to md0 removing steps above.
        - 2) "mdadm --create /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1"
        - 3) Monitor '/proc/mdstat' to check if md0 created and running.
        - 4) "mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0"
        - 5) "mount /dev/md0 /mnt"
        - 6) "echo 'RAID5 test' > /mnt/raid5-test.txt"
        - 7) "mdadm --manage --set-faulty /dev/md0 /dev/sdd1"
        - 8) "mdadm --manage /dev/md0 -r /dev/sdd1"
        - 9) Verify that '/mnt/raid5-test.txt' is not damaged.
        - 10) "mdadm --manage /dev/md0 -a /dev/sdd1"
        - 11) Monitor the output of "mdadm --detail /dev/md0" and make sure
              that md0 'rebuilding' can be finished.

    expected:
        - RAID array creating, deleting and rebuilding are successful.
        - Read/write performance on RAID0 is faster then single disk.
        - When one disk of RAID1/RAID5 damaged or removed, no data loss.
        - When faulty disk replaced with a new one, RAID1/RAID5 can be rebuilt.
