Senthil may remember that better, the work around is proposed by him.\n\nIn Ubuntu xenial, with latest adb, \u0027adb root\u0027 without \u0027\u0026\u0027 works, we also don\u0027t need \u0027sleep 10\u0027 there. I am not sure if we should still care about other distributions and other adb versions.",

      "message": "Instead of doing \u0027sleep 10\u0027, a more appropriate fix would be to loop until a valid device appears - based on something other than \u0027no device found\u0027 or \u0027unknown\u0027, maybe a valid serial number?\n\nThis is because, it will always get hard to predict what is the right value of sleep, specially when the host machine is under load the values may need a higher number than 10.",
