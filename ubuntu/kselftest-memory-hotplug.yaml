    description: "The kernel contains a set of 'self tests' under the tools/testing/selftests/
                  directory. These are intended to be small unit tests to exercise individual
                  code paths in the kernel. This test runs memory-hotplug tests. Memory-hotplug
                  allows to increase/decrease the amount of memory required by highly virtualized
                  environments or required by hardware which supports memory power management."
