    description: "The kernel contains a set of 'self tests' under the tools/testing/selftests/.
                  These are intended to be small unit tests to exercise individual code paths
                  in the kernel. kself-ptrace uses ptrace or process trace system call that
                  provides a means by which one process can observe and control the execution
                  of another process and examine and change the tracee's memory and registers."
