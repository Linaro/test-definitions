    description: "latency-test sets up and runs one or two real-time threads.Each time a thread is started by the
                  scheduler, the code set up by latency-test gets the time and subtracts from it the previous time
                  the same thread started. latency-test determines the maximum deviation (both larger and smaller)
                  of this difference compared to the selected period, compares the absolute values of the two deviations,
                  and reports the larger absolute value as the max jitter."
