OK for now, but need to be updated somehow pretty quickly. It won\u0027t be that uncommon to run the same fio on different drives (or with Ceph).",

      "message": "Params has been added to result dictionary(line #238), and it also will be saved to result.json as json.dump() able to convert the dictionary directly.\n\nFor result.csv, test name added, but I haven\u0027t figured out how to handle test params properly. Different test case may have different params, so csv header may vary.  \n\nIf it is really needed in CSV file, I think we can detect the key of parms and append it to csv header(fieldnames), the final csv header could be sth like\n[\u0027test\u0027, \u0027test_case_id\u0027, \u0027result\u0027, \u0027measurement\u0027, \u0027units\u0027, \u0027param_skip_install\u0027, \u0027param_iteration\u0027, \u0027param_device\u0027, \u0027param_*\u0027]",
