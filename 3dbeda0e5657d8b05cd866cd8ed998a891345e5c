To do that, we handle package installation in test script, not using the lava feature.

      "message": "I read the previous discussion. \n\nYeah, we\u0027d better host the yaml definition file and test script files in the same repo. Normally \u0027git\u0027 related commands should go to test script. I understand it is not possible to do that way here, as the script is not exist before the \u0027git clone\u0027. BTW, our local test runner doesn\u0027t support \u0027git-repos\u0027 param from yaml file. \n\nIf the script isn\u0027t for verification, then why the yaml file is? If it is a common tool, as Anders suggested, I guess you can put it to automated/utils",
