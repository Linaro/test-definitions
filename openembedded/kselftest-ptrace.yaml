    description: "Linux kernel Kselftest-ptrace test for Linaro OpenEmbedded builds. The kernel contains
                  a set of 'self tests' under the tools/testing/selftests/ directory. These are intended
                  to be small unit tests to exercise individual code paths. kself-ptrace test uses ptrace
                  or process trace system call that provides a means by which, one process can observe and
                  control the execution of another process and examine and change the tracee's memory and
                  registers."
