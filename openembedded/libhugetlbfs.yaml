                  Runs through 64 bit libhugetlbfs on target system. 
                  One needs to run with a kernel that supports huge pages, 
                  also the OpenEmbedded system needs to have the libhugetlbfs 
                  test suite pre-installed. (Which is the case for recent 
                  OpenEmbedded builds)."
