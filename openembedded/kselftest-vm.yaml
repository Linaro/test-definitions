    description: "Linux kernel Kselftest-vm test for Linaro OpenEmbedded builds. The kernel contains
                  a set of 'self tests' under the tools/testing/selftests/ directory. These are intended
                  to be small unit tests to exercise individual code paths. kselftest-vm tests huge page
                  memory in a user application using the mmap and Sys V shared memory system calls. It
                  also tests selecting other page sizes for mmap/shmget and stress test for transparent
                  huge pages, memory compaction and migration."
