    description: "Test CPU Isolation with NOHZ and CPUSETS on Linaro Ubuntu and OpenEmbedded builds.
                  The test isolates 1 CPU (from list of CPU's) from other background kernel activities
                  and runs task on the isolated CPU(s) and figures out if CPUs are isolated or not by
                  reading 'cat /proc/interrupts' for all interrupts. ISOL_CPU, ITERATIONS and ISOL_MIN are
                  set to 1, 5 and 10 respectively by default which can be changed via JSON file."
