    description: "Linux kernel Kselftest-memory-hotplug test for Linaro OpenEmbedded builds. The kernel
                  contains a set of 'self tests' under the tools/testing/selftests/ directory. These are
                  intended to be small unit tests to exercise individual code paths.This test runs memory-hotplug
                  test. Memory-hotplug allows to increase/decrease the amount of memory required by highly
                  virtualized environments or required by hardware which supports memory power management."
