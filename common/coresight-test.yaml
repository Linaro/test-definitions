    description: "To validate coresight source to sink writes.
     Coresight tracing support provides a kernel interface for the CoreSight
     debug and trace drivers to register themselves with. It's intended to build
     topological view of the CoreSight components based on a DT specification
     and configure the right serie of components when a trace source gets
     enabled. Required kernel configs
     CONFIG_CORESIGHT=y
     CONFIG_CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS=y"
