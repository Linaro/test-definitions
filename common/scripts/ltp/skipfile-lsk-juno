# The testcase seems to be broken unless you have big enough swap so that
# CommitLimit (which depends on size of the swap) is greater than
# Commit_AS. In your case the swap size was not big enough to be greater
# than the amount of currently overcommited memory (Commit_AS).

# The test should be changed to skip the particular testcase and give a
# beteter message if there is no room to alloace any memory in this case.
