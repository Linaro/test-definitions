# connection setups using `adb connect` are used to check if the device is reachable after this
# call.

# Arguments:
#   adb_tcpip_attempts  Number of tries for enabling adb TCP/IP mode on the device
#   timeout_secs        Timeout for waiting for getting the IP address from the device
#   adb_port            Network port to use for adb TCP/IP
# Returns:
#   0 only if the device is accessible via adb TCP/IP, 1 otherwise.
