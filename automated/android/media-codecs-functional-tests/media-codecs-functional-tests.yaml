    description: "Media functional codecs test suite for linaro android
                  verifies arm based audio/video software codecs available in
                  Android AOSP release. These codecs are used in implementation
                  of SW based OMX decoders. Some of these codecs are developed
                  by Google like VP8/VP9 and some others by third parties like
                  PacketVideo for mp3."
