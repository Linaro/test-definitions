    description: "Perform device factory reset.
      The end result should be a device filesystem
      restored to the condition after initial manufacturing.
      Only a limited subset of files is checked.
      Reset type is evaluated in the following priority:

        1. factory_reset
        2. factory_reset_keep_sota
        3. factory_reset_keep_sota_docker

      If higher priority type is present, lower priority
      type is ignored.

      Device can be registered with specifig tag using LABEL variable.
      Device can be registered with HSM using HSM_MODULE variable.
