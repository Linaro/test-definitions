    description: "The rtla osnoise tool is an interface for the osnoise tracer.
                  The osnoise tracer dispatches a kernel thread per-cpu.
                  These threads read the time in a loop while with preemption,
                  softirq and IRQs enabled, thus allowing all the sources of
                  operating system noise during its execution. The osnoiseâ€™s
                  tracer threads take note of the delta between each time
                  read, along with an interference counter of all sources of
                  interference. At the end of each period, the osnoise tracer
                  displays a summary of the results."
