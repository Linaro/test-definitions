    description: "The rtla timerlat tool is an interface for the timerlat
                  tracer. The timerlat tracer dispatches a kernel thread per-cpu.
                  These threads set a periodic timer to wake themselves up and
                  go back to sleep. After the wakeup, they collect and generate
                  useful information for the debugging of operating system
                  timer latency."
