    # SKIPFILE can be a filename from dir ./automated/linux/ltp/, an http URL,
    # or a skipgen style yaml file.

    #   SKIPFILE: "http://people.linaro.org/~naresh.kamboju/skipfile"
    #   SKIPFILE: "skipfile-lkft.yaml" # yaml file that will be parsed with
    #                                  # skipgen. Must use "yaml" extention.
    # NOTE: busybox wget may not work with https link so prefer to use http
