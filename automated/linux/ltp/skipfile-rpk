# oom01 tries to kill bash and python which are needed by our test script.
# Prevent oom01 from doing the above causes 'Kernel panic - not syncing: Out of memory and no killable processes...'
# The issue needs to be fixed from ltp. Refer to https://projects.linaro.org/browse/QA-1662

# By default, Debian installer will set the size of swap partition to the size
# of memory capacity. min_free_kbytes needs to occupy both memory and swap
# space. When memory size is large, this test takes hours to finish.
# For example, on D05 that 128G memory installed, this test takes 191 minutes.
# It can be finished, but just too long. It is possbile to customize
# partitioning steps to reduce swap partition size for this single test, but
# that is probably not wanted.

# msgctl10 fails on qdf 2400. Not only does it fail, it also does not seem to
# finish cleanly and cause other tests to fail inconsistently, and all of LTP
# to exit early (as observed by the number of test results)
