    description: "Hackbench is both a benchmark and a stress test for the Linux
                  kernel scheduler. It's main job is to create a specified
                  number of pairs of schedulable entities (either threads or
                  traditional processes) which communicate via either sockets or
                  pipes and time how long it takes for each pair to send data
                  back and forth."
