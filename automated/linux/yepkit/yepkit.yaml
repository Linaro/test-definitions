    description: "Yepkit YKUSH USB Hub library

    This library will build and install the YepKit YKUSH library if not already
    installed.

    It will allow the user to operate the YepKit USB hub ports, and will optionally
    check if the expected device was added to the system.

    It is not intended to be a test of the Yepkit device itself, but to provide
    the functionality of the device to other tests."
