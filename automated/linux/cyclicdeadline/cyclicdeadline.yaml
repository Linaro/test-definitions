    format: "Lava-Test Test Definition 1.0"
    description: "cyclicdeadline is a test that is similar to cyclictest
                  but instead of using SCHED_FIFO and nanosleep() to
                  measure jitter, it uses SCHED_DEADLINE and has the
                  deadline be the wakeup interval."
