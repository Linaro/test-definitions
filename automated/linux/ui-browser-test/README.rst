Robot framework tests
+++++++++++++++++++++
Robot Framework is a generic test automation framework for acceptance testing
and acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). It has easy-to-use tabular test
data syntax and it utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach. Its testing
capabilities can be extended by test libraries implemented either with Python
or Java, and users can create new higher-level keywords from existing ones
using the same syntax that is used for creating test cases. reference: [1]
