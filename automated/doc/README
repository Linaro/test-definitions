Getting started
===============
    git clone https://git.linaro.org/qa/test-definitions.git
    cd ./test-definitions/automated-tests
    . ./setenv.sh
    test-runner -h

Running tests
=============
Both test script and corresponding test definition files provided in the same
folder that named with the test case name.

Test script can be run independently, you may need to specify parameters
manually as needed.

Test definition file in YAML format created for each test to
  - Define default test parameters
  - Run test with local test-runner, which supports to run a set of tests
    defined in agenda file, customized parameters are supported as well.
  - Run test in LAVA(Linaro Automation and Validation Architecture)

Run test script
---------------
linux:
    cd linux/smoke/
    ./smoke.sh
    # skip package installation.
    ./smoke.sh -s true

android:
    cd android/dd-wr-speed/
    ./dd-wr-speed.sh
    # Specify SN when more than one device connected.
    ./dd-wr-speed.sh -s "serial_no"
    # Specify other params.
    ./dd-wr-speed.sh -i "10" -p "/dev/block/mmcblk1p1"

Using test-runner
----------------
single test run:
    test-runner -d linux/smoke/smoke.yaml
    # skip package install
    test-runner -d linux/smoke/smoke.yaml -s

multiple tests run:
    # Run a set of tests defined in agenda file.
    test-runner -a agendas/linux-agenda-example.yaml

Test results
===========
Please fine test results in the following locations.
 - ${OUTPUT} and ${REAUSLT_FILES} for each test are defined in the test case.
 - test-runner parse stdout.log and save result to ${test_path}
 - test-runner collect results of executed tests in ${OUTPUT}/results.csv,
   ${OUTPUT} of test runner can be modified with '-o'
