      "message": "I\u0027m trying to understand the sequence here. There is a call to install_deps in line 14. Than the SKIP_INSTALL variable is set and there is another call to install_deps here with if statement. Looks wrong to me. The if statement is already included in the install_deps and calling the function twice most likely isn\u0027t needed. I guess removing the if clause and moving the install_deps call below the while loop would do the job.",
