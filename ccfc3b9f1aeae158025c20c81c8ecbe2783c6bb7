      "message": "Well, yes, sometimes less code is better but for this case, there are only 2 options, do you really think we should involve lambda stuff, and string format?\nI have to say, sometimes I don\u0027t like that \u0027pythonic\u0027 thing. I read many materials related to it, but in my opinion the code is written to be read by people, who may have variety programming backgrounds, \u0027read-and-understand\u0027 probably is a better way to go with, though I certainly agree on some certain problems, \u0027pythonic\u0027 is beautiful.\nIn this particular case, I do have some ideas before I wrote the code, go through a list was the first one popped up in my mind. But considering the simplicity, I decided to go with the direct way.",
