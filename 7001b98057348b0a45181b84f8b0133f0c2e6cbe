      "message": "Once the gparser.apk was installed, the \"org.linaro.gparser\" folder will be created, the \"files\" folder is the default location to read and save files, I didn\u0027t indicate any path in the apk. Even I don\u0027t create it manually, it will be created by the first run of the App.\n\nI think if we don\u0027t have permission to create, read and write files under the /data/data/ folder, the apk installation will fail, either. Basically, the assumption is the system under test is rooted.\n\nI could be wrong. Please let me know if we really need change the location.",
