    description: "Tjbench is used to benchmark the performance of libjpeg-turbo and libjpeg62 for android.
                  For each test image, the tjbench program is used to measure the compression and decompression
                  performance and the compression ratio obtained when compressing the test image as a JPEG image
                  and then decompressing the JPEG image back to its original, uncompressed form."
