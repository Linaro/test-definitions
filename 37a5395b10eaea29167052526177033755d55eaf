      "message": "The problem here is it only saves the output of last test run(64bit v3_0) to the logfile as tee uses overwrite mode by default.\n\nYou probably want to use separate log file to save output for post processing, sth like 32bit-v1-xxx, 64bit-v3-xx, etc. In this way, the following parsing lines should be updated to parse each of the log files.\n\nIf you want to save all the output to the same log file, use \u0027tee -a\u0027 instead. If output formats are the same, the following parsing line can stay as it is.",
